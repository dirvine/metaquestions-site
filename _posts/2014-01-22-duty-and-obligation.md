The article discusses the distinction between duty (being honorable and ethical) and obligation (following the law), inspired by a SlashDot comment about Lavabit. The author argues that when laws are stretched beyond morality—whether for tax avoidance or security overreach—duty should take precedence.

## Key Points

> "You have a duty to be honourable and ethical. You have an obligation to do what is legal. They are not the same things." — Jane Q Public

- **MaidSafe's Position:** The company has a duty to provide Privacy, Security, and Freedom to everyone while remaining legally compliant. They cannot hand over user information due to their system design.

- **Duty vs Legal Obligation:** The author uses the example of jaywalking to help someone in danger—duty should override legal obligation in such cases.

- **Historical Context:** References NSA overreach and historical atrocities that occurred when people followed obligations over their duty to humanity.

- **Conclusion:** MaidSafe's vision aligns with their duty, and they commend Lavabit for prioritizing duty over obligation.
