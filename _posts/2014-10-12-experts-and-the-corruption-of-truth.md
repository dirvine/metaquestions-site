This blog post is a philosophical rant about the limitations of expertise, mathematical proofs, and scientific validation. The author argues that complex equations, peer-reviewed papers, and experimental measurements are often used as badges of authority rather than true understanding.

## Key Points

- **Math proofs can be misleading:** Examples like D1HT (a DHT technology that looked impressive on paper but failed when built), historical misconceptions about bees flying, and aircraft wing physics
- **Measurements don't prove theories:** They only agree with a thesis within limited variables
- **Repeatability is limited:** Depends on what variables are tested
- **Historical examples of "proven" science being wrong:** Newton → Einstein → Hawking corrections, the number zero being rejected for 600 years
- **Security evolves:** RSA encryption becoming less secure due to computing power, discrete math advances, and cloud computing

## Conclusion

There are no shortcuts or final proofs. The author advocates being an "explorer" rather than an "expert" or "believer." He acknowledges the tension between wanting to give simple answers and knowing that partial truths can be closer to lies than saying nothing.
