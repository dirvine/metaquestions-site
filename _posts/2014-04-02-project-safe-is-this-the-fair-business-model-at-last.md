This technical blog post explores Project SAFE and the MaidSafe network's proposed business model using safecoin cryptocurrency. The author discusses how the system would provide free access to users while incentivizing resource providers (miners) with safecoins.
## The Free Lunch Paradox
- Users get free access to the network
- Resource providers (miners) earn safecoins for contributing disk space, bandwidth, and CPU
- The value lies in protecting humanity's collective knowledge, not just physical resources
## Safecoin Economics
- Created through "proof of resource" rather than wasteful mining
- Physical resource costs decrease exponentially over time
- Data value increases over time
## Developer Revenue Model
- Developers insert wallet address into GET requests
- Earn 10% of safecoin mining from their application usage
- Network automatically measures and rewards based on app popularity
- No installers needed - apps shared at file system level
## Anti-Gaming Mechanisms
- Copied apps face market forces and network effects
- Fake GET requests trigger "no-mine" signals
- Data comes from cache for repeated requests
## Fallback Position
If safecoin fails as currency, becomes internal resource token. Bidding system for resources if demand exceeds supply.
