A reflective essay on the nature of visions for change, using MaidSafe's emergence as context. The author categorizes people's reactions to transformative visions into three groups and explores how visions evolve, who owns them, and lessons for those pursuing meaningful change.
## MaidSafe's Vision
Privacy, Security, and Freedom for all the world's people.
## Three Groups of People
1. **The "Care Later" Group (~1/3):** Support the vision but too busy/stressed to engage now
2. **The "No Way" Team (~1/3):** Actively oppose change - includes those previously lied to, status quo protectors, and ego-driven critics
3. **The Kindred Spirits (~1/3):** Jump in, ask questions, become defenders of the vision itself
## Key Insights
- Nobody owns a vision - it belongs to the movement
- Opposition (Group 2) actually strengthens visions by forcing testing and refinement
- Nature slows evolution so surroundings can adapt; critics serve this brake function
- Success comes from believing in the vision above profit, ego, and self
- Don't aim for perfection initially - evolution is continuous
