This blog post explores how the SAFE network can enable secure, autonomous data sharing across industries including autonomous vehicles, robotics/AI, and healthcare. The author argues that traditional server-based systems are vulnerable to corruption and proposes using Mutable Data types with multisig ownership to create decentralized, incorruptible data sharing systems.
## Autonomous Vehicle Industry
Proposes vehicle manufacturers (Ford, GM, Tesla) creating shared Mutable Data items with multisig ownership, allowing vehicles to communicate securely and validate each other cryptographically.
## Robotic & AI Industries
Describes how robots could share learned information globally (room mappings, skills, repair locations) using hierarchical key structures and delegate voting systems.
## Healthcare Industry
Suggests removing medical records entirely, using anonymous scanning devices that share treatment outcomes globally without needing patient names, potentially revolutionizing healthcare delivery.
## Core Concept
The SAFE network's Mutable Data types allow creation of fixed network addresses owned by multiple entities through multisig, enabling collaboration without any single party having control. This removes the need for trusted third parties and prevents data corruption.
## Conclusion
The post envisions autonomous, connected, non-owned data systems that could be self-managing after initial human setup, with many current security and ownership issues simply evaporating in a secure autonomous network.
