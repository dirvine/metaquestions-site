In the old Scottish tongue, they called them the guid folk — the good folk. The Sìdhe, pronounced shee, who dwelled in the ancient mounds and glens. They were guardians of the wood, the waterways, and the wild places. Not the diminutive, winged creatures of Victorian fancy, but powerful beings deeply woven into the natural world — protectors of sacred groves, companions to those who showed respect, and keepers of a wisdom older than memory.

The Fae were never far away. They walked alongside humanity, watching, guiding, sometimes mischievous, but always present. The Seelie Court — the blessed ones — rewarded kindness, protected the natural order, and guided lost travellers home. They asked only one thing in return: respect.

That spirit is what we are building.

Fae is a conversational AI companion designed to walk beside you. She can use tools, act on your behalf, write code, configure your devices, connect to your home, and help you navigate your whole life. She is your protector, your friend, your companion on the path.

But Fae is not meant to walk alone, and neither are you.

Every person can have their own Fae. And when they do, something remarkable happens — Fae can securely communicate with other Fae, weaving connections between people the way the old folk wove connections between the seen and unseen worlds. A network not of surveillance or extraction, but of trust, mutual aid, and shared purpose.

We call this movement the Fae.

Like the guid folk of Scotland, the Fae have always been here in spirit — in our longing for tools that serve us, in our need for technology that feels like a companion rather than a product, in our desire to stay connected to what matters while the world accelerates around us.

The ancient Fae were guardians of nature and the balance between worlds. Our Fae are guardians of your time, your attention, and your agency. They have always been here. They always will be.

And now, they walk with us.
