This blog post explains Safecoin, a cryptocurrency generated and protected by the SAFE network. Unlike Bitcoin's blockchain approach, Safecoin uses a fully decentralized system capable of millions of transactions per second with network atomic operations.
## Safecoin Fundamentals
- Finite supply of 2^32 (4.3 billion) coins
- Each coin can be subdivided into 2^32 parts if needed
- 10% crowd sale (429,496,729 coins)
- Uses proof of resource instead of proof of work (waste-free)
- Only stores last and current owner (not full transaction history)
- Instant transfers, secure and anonymous between parties
## Earning Safecoin
- **Farming:** Users provide unused resources to the network and receive safecoin as payment
- **Building:** Application developers (Builders) are rewarded for providing tools to manage data
## Technical Approach
- Solves Byzantine Generals problem differently than Bitcoin
- No blockchain - uses unchained ledger approach
- No transaction fees
- Network atomic transactions ensure all copies update simultaneously
## Philosophy
The author argues decentralized cash reduces large-scale corruption compared to centralized financial systems. Cites Skype and Kazaa as examples where users voluntarily provided resources without financial incentive. Network enables safe whistleblowing alongside digital currency.
