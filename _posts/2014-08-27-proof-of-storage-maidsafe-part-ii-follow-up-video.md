A follow-up post explaining how MaidSafe uses hashes to identify data and self-encryption for data security. The post distinguishes between "logical security" (encryption) and "physical security" (distributed storage across a decentralized network).
## Logical Security
- Self-encryption process secures data beyond known decryption abilities
## Physical Security
- Data scattered across the globe on many machines owned by many people
- No single entity knows what data they hold
- Cannot disable or corrupt data in ways affecting network copies
- No third party between user and their data
- Autonomous network monitors nodes, not humans
- Vandalism attempts result in automatic replication and de-ranking of offending machines (loss of safecoin earnings)
## Why Both Are Needed
- Cloud providers monitor uploads/downloads, creating security leaks
- Disks and tapes are searchable and may not be truly secure
- Both physical and logical security are required for true data protection
