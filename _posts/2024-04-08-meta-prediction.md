A prediction on AI and how it relates to the AutonomI network (previously known as the SAFE network).
## Observation
AI/LLMs are here - we can now talk to computers and they can talk back. This is coming in several forms: agentic, multi-modal, fine-tuned, RAG, and differing model sizes.
## Predictions
- Direct hardware access will be AI's API (bypassing OS level)
- Apps and browsers as we know them will be bypassed
- Most human written code will be replaced by direct human-to-machine capabilities
- Files and directories become antiques
- Humanoid robots will extend computers to the physical world
## Effect on AutonomI
AutonomI must protect humanity by securing personal AI. Centrally controlled AI is described as dangerous. The network should provide secure, private, personal AI conversations accessible only to the individual user.
## Agents
Agents are configurations applied to LLMs for specialized tasks (CEO, Software Developer, Q/A, etc.). They delegate tasks, use tools, check each other's output, and enable planning/recursion/long-term workloads.
## Autonomi and Agents
AutonomI allows publishing and versioning of agents. Others can use them and pay creators - enabling decentralized community-created content sharing.
