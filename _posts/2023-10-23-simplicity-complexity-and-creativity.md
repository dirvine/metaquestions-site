The author reflects on the surprising simplicity of modern AI systems like LLMs, arguing that their success challenges assumptions about complexity and intelligence.
## Key Themes
- **Simplicity of LLMs**: The "attention is all you need" approach and "guessing the next token" produced human-level capabilities with remarkably simple architecture
- **Creativity as hallucination**: Creativity involves imagining/hallucinating, testing ideas, and iterating - similar to how LLMs work
- **Critique of complexity**: Professionals often favor complexity to boost ego, but nature favors simplicity; complex papers do little for humanity
- **Context limitations**: Current AI limitations stem from small context windows, not fundamental capability issues
- **SAFE Network connection**: The author's work on the SAFE network follows similar principles - simplicity in components leading to sophisticated emergent behavior (like ant colonies)
> "It's not about genius through complexity, it's about genius through simplicity."
