The article critiques various political and economic systems (Capitalism, Communism, Fascism, Socialism, etc.) arguing they all fail because self-interest corrupts each system. The author proposes "Proof of Resource" as a mathematical solution for creating a fair society where work is rewarded and value is recognized appropriately.
## Proof of Resource
A system where people build or do something of value, have it recognized mathematically, and get rewarded accordingly. Uses healthcare as an example where all actions leading to positive outcomes are rewarded based on a fraction of total contributions.
## Measuring Outcomes
Rather than cataloging every action, the system measures outcomes (e.g., life expectancy for healthcare) and subdivides value to constituent parts.
> "A billionaire only represents a system imbalance, we should not see that as a success, but a failure to balance."
The author promises a follow-up post with detailed implementation and argues this approach eliminates political manipulation since it's based on mathematics and physics rather than lobbying.
