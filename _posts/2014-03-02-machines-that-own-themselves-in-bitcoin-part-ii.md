This blog post is the second part of a series exploring how machines can own themselves using bitcoin and autonomous networks. The author discusses how combining bitcoin with autonomous data networks like MaidSafe could enable self-driving taxis and other machines to communicate, share data, and operate with maximum financial efficiency.
## Key Topics Covered
- **Autonomous Networks**: How MaidSafe enables machines to store, share, and analyze data together
- **The Dark Side**: Privacy concerns about surveillance if autonomous systems could recognize and track people
- **Medical Advances**: Vision of whole-body scans analyzed by machines using Bayesian inference, enabling preventive healthcare
- **The End of Corruption**: How logical machine systems would reject bribes and eliminate tax avoidance loopholes
- **Removing Wealth Imbalances**: Supply matching demand exactly, with baseline needs (food, water, shelter) guaranteed
- **Learning to Dream Again**: Freeing humans from debt-driven work to focus on innovation and exploration
The author argues that bent or corrupt logic weakens systems and that mathematically complete autonomous systems naturally resist manipulation.
