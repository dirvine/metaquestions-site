This blog post discusses MaidSafe's business strategy for creating a decentralized internet.
## Key Topics
- **World changes**: Financial system collapse, government corruption, growing inequality as drivers for change
- **MaidSafe technology**: Described as a fully distributed network and "world's first" autonomous network with self-authentication
- **Patents**: Defense of MaidSafe's patent portfolio as protection against trolls rather than offensive weapons; broad claims covering distributed internet technology
- **Licensing model**: Dual license approach - GPL for open community ownership, and non-GPL option for commercial use
- **Revenue model**: Two options - 1% license fee on revenue, or token-based system where project tokens increase in value together
- **Applications**: Consumer internet (private data sharing, video, social networks, email), AI/robotics, medicine (secure records, machine learning for diagnostics), and trade (cryptocurrency, voting systems)
The post emphasizes community building, protecting innovators through patents, and creating value through collaboration rather than extraction.
