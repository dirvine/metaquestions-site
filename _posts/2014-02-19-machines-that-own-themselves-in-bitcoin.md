This blog post explores the concept of autonomous machines that own themselves using Bitcoin. The author envisions robotic workers (like waiters) that earn Bitcoin for services, pay for their own power and repairs, and eventually become self-owning after paying back their builders.

## Key Concepts

- **Self-sustaining robots**: Machines that charge customers in Bitcoin, pay for electricity and repairs from their own wallet
- **Payback model**: After repaying the builder, the robot owns itself and can choose where to work
- **End of life**: Robots check themselves into builders for repurposing or parts, paying with remaining Bitcoin

## Examples Given

- Autonomous cars
- Service station attendants
- Aeroplanes
- Trains

The author predicted this future within 6 years (from 2014). Security features like tamper-proof wallets are mentioned.
