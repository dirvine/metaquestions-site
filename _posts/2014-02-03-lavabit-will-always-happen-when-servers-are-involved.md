title: "Lavabit will always happen when servers are involved"

The author argues that centralized servers and human involvement inevitably lead to corruption and privacy failures (like the Lavabit case). The post advocates for decentralized, math-based networks that don't store human-readable data.
## Key Arguments
- Power corrupts throughout history (Roman Empire, British Empire, various "isms")
- Secure servers, web of trust, friend networks, closed-source networks, and even Tor won't fix privacy issues because humans are involved at servers
- The solution: a fully math-based network providing encryption, obfuscation, and data protection with a symbiotic relationship with humans
- Bitcoin demonstrates decentralization protected by logic and math
- "Servers and centralisation are unnatural and will always fail"
