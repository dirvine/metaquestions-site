title: "Bitcoin price in dollars will soon be irrelevant (it should be now)"

The author expresses enthusiasm for Bitcoin despite initially having reservations about its shortfalls. The main argument is that Bitcoin's price in fiat currencies (dollars, euros, pounds) shouldn't matter because Bitcoin is a trading mechanism that allows borderless transfer of goods and services.
## Key Points
- Bitcoin enables living entirely within its ecosystem - sending money to family, buying goods, etc.
- The author compares Bitcoin's emergence to the Gutenberg press - once education spreads, it cannot be unlearned
- While acknowledging deficiencies in privacy, scalability, and security, the author believes these are solvable
- Uses analogy: Americans don't care about euro prices in daily life; similarly, Bitcoin users won't care about dollar conversion rates
- Lists practical Bitcoin uses: starting businesses with colored coins, blockchain notarization, payroll (BitPay), global purchases
- Mentions MaidSafe as a solution for data/knowledge protection
- Describes early adopters entering "Society 2.0"
