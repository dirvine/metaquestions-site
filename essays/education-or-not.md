**Dedication:** To all who have not been given enough chances to succeed and to a night in 'the Kings' on Friday 11th March 1983.

## Abstract

A story of art, maths, physiology, science in a single collection known as knowledge. A story of questions with no answer, answers which question current knowledge, and mostly a story of hope that we can ask large questions of small issues.

## Basic Schooling

A critique of rote learning and times tables. The essay advocates teaching "why" before "how" - understanding the reasoning behind mathematical operations rather than memorizing facts.

## Teaching Ideas

Alternative methods for arithmetic using only addition. Explores how fundamental operations can be built from simpler concepts, making mathematics more accessible.

## Far Outside the Box

Left-to-right vs right-to-left counting, working with irrational numbers. Challenges conventional assumptions about how we represent and manipulate numbers.

## Gravity

Discussion of gravity as the weakest force, momentum, and our understanding of fundamental physics. Questions what we truly know versus what we assume.

## Nature

Nature as life's textbook. Includes examples like photosynthesis demonstration and how natural systems teach us about efficiency and design.

## Zero & Infinity

Mathematical concepts of zero and infinity as "notions" rather than concrete numbers. Explores the philosophical implications of these boundary concepts.

## Limits and Things

How limits govern mathematical concepts. Discusses the role of boundaries in defining mathematical operations and their real-world applications.

## Number Bases and Time

Base 12/60 systems in timekeeping. Explores why we use different number bases for different purposes and the historical reasons behind our time system.

## Analogue vs Digital Measurements

Comparison of measurement systems. Discusses the trade-offs between continuous and discrete representations of reality.

## Time

Relativity, GPS corrections, time dilation. Explores how our understanding of time has evolved and its practical implications in modern technology.

## Truth

The nature of truth and accepted falsehoods in education. Challenges assumptions about what we teach as "fact" versus what we actually know.

## Our Own Bodies

Cell replacement and identity. Explores the philosophical question of continuity when the physical matter of our bodies is constantly changing.

## Further Education

A critique of specialization in higher education. Argues for a more integrated approach to learning that connects different fields of knowledge.

## Laws and Theories

The distinction between scientific laws and theories. Clarifies common misconceptions about the strength and nature of scientific knowledge.

## E=MC²

Questions about Einstein's equation and the speed of light. Explores what this famous equation actually tells us and what mysteries remain.

## Nature of Thought

Language, perception of goodness, consciousness. Explores how our thoughts are shaped by the tools we use to express them.

## Nature of Consciousness

Theory of collective consciousness and death as nature's filter. A philosophical exploration of what consciousness might be and its role in evolution.

## An Option For The Future

A blueprint for educational reform. Proposes changes to how we structure learning to better prepare people for the real world.

## The New University

A proposal for certificate-free education with payment for attendance. Reimagines higher education as a service that rewards engagement and learning rather than credentials.
