This post discusses how XOR (exclusive or) operations can be used to structure decentralized networks. XOR provides unique distance metrics that differ from traditional linear distance calculations, making it useful for distributed hash tables and peer-to-peer networking.
The mathematical properties of XOR create interesting network topologies where each node has a unique perspective of the network, enhancing security and resilience.
