David Irvine explains the vision behind the SAFE network - what he calls "The Impossible Network." He argues that the term "decentralized Internet" has become overused and no longer differentiates MaidSafe from other projects. Instead, he introduces the concept of an **Autonomous Network** - a network with zero human intervention that self-configures, self-heals, and manages itself entirely through code.
## What Makes SAFE Different
- **Autonomous Network**: No human intervention, no federated servers, no identifiable nodes
- Network decides prices, rewards, and data protection - not humans
- Self-authentication: users create accounts without intermediaries
- IP addresses masked to prevent snooping
- Must be secured against all known threats (Sybil attacks, DOS attacks, etc.)
## Development Roadmap (as of 2017)
- **Alpha 2**: Replicating current Internet-based applications
- **Alpha 3**: Data Chains Part 1 - secures groups of nodes, creates autonomous network foundation
- **Alpha 4**: Reintroduces user-run vaults (farming software)
- **Beta/Launch**: Test safecoin introduction
## Potential Applications
- Autonomous transport data sharing
- IoT device security and data sharing
- Home automation without corporate surveillance
- Elimination of server-based cyber attacks
- No password storage/theft
