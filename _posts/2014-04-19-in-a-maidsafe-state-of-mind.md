This blog post discusses David Irvine's approach to innovation and the "MaidSafe way" of thinking. He outlines key principles for tackling complex problems:
- Find a vision and pursue it fully
- Consider "impossible" problems as solvable
- Understand the core logic of issues
- Use solutions to integrate with subsequent problems
- Be prepared to start over multiple times
- Accept uncertainty until all parts complement each other
The post explores the difference between inventors (who may create a single thing) and innovators (who constantly seek the next problem). Irvine discusses the challenges of step-change innovations versus incremental improvements, noting that large innovations are harder to fund and explain than simple soundbite-ready ideas.
He emphasizes that true innovators are driven by seeing the human impact of their work—"the faces of the children who will die if this is not done"—rather than monetization. The post concludes by connecting this to MaidSafe's Project SAFE vision: giving people control, reducing stress, and enabling them to dream and create solutions.
The article includes references to Jonas Salk's decision to give away the polio cure and discusses the innovator's dilemma in seeking critique while avoiding negativity.
