This post clarifies the SAFE Network concept, distinguishing it from blockchain-based data storage projects.
## Key Points
- SAFE is an **autonomous network** that protects data without human intermediaries
- The currency (safecoin) is literally a **data type** on the network, not a separate add-on
- The **network itself is the ledger** (private, not public like blockchain)
- Unlike projects that store only hashes on-chain with data "somewhere else," SAFE stores and protects the actual data
- Farmers get paid to store data, commercializing unused disk space globally
- The network controls all costs, rewards, storage, access, communications and currency autonomously
> "If you are to remember one thing about SAFE, it is **the network**, not any humans, which protects our data."
