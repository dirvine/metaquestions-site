This blog post argues that ethics in business, like security, requires openness and transparency. The author draws parallels between the security industry's requirement for full disclosure of algorithms and the need for businesses to be openly ethical.
## Ethics and Exploitation
Many companies claim ethics but practice exploitation. True ethics requires openness and the ability to adjust, similar to how security researchers operate with public algorithms.
## Open Ethics, or None
MaidSafe's approach to openness: open code, open development, public Google Hangout sessions, transparent debates. Argues that openness and privacy are complementary.
## Sell Value or Shut
Ethical business means actual value exchange, not marketing manipulation. Suggests ethical companies can be highly profitable by including customers in product design.
## Profit for the Long-Term
Advocates for growing an ecosystem of like-minded partners rather than becoming a corporate giant. Compares this to grass growing together for mutual protection. Emphasizes that profits should come from providing genuine value.
> "Closed companies should be considered unethical just as a closed security algorithm should be considered flawed."
