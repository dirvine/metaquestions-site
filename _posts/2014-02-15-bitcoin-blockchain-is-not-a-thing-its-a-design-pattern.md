The article argues that Bitcoin's value lies not in the blockchain itself, but in its ability to cryptographically confirm transactions in a non-reversible manner. The author emphasizes that the blockchain is a mechanism to agree on transaction locks, not a universal solution.
## Key Points
- **Blockchain as design pattern**: The blockchain should be viewed as an evolving design pattern, not a single centralized data structure to build everything upon
- **Decentralization concerns**: The blockchain is currently "distributed centralized" - truly decentralized systems should not share core components
- **Nature analogy**: Natural systems (ants, plants, wolves) are decentralized and co-exist without sharing core parts - they connect at the edges
- **Projects like MasterCoin and Ethereum**: While valuable, the author is concerned about over-reliance on a single blockchain
- **Evolution needed**: The blockchain structure may need to decentralize further; merkle trees aren't the answer as they still have a root (centralized point)
## Author's Position
- Not attacking Bitcoin - believes it will exist for many years
- Believes centralized structures within Bitcoin (like Mt Gox) will fail
- Advocates for projects to use decentralised mechanisms with agreed, open algorithms rather than simply building on "the blockchain"
