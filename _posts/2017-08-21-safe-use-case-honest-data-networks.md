This blog post discusses the limitations of blockchain-based projects that claim to secure data by storing only hashes (data identifiers) on the blockchain rather than the actual data. The author argues that the SAFE Network solves this problem by storing and securing the actual data in the same location.
## The Problem with Current Blockchain Solutions
- Many projects store only data identifiers (hashes) on the blockchain, not the actual data
- This means "where is the data?" becomes the critical unanswered question
- These projects only lock data identifiers, not the data itself
- Compared to "a passport showing up for an interview instead of the actual person"
## Secure Document Records Issues
- Projects claiming to "make data honest" or prevent rewriting history fall short
- Land transactions, medical research records etc. are not truly secured
- The blockchain doesn't secure documents - only transaction data
## Decentralized Network Issues
- Many "Internet 2.0/3.0" projects also only store identifiers on blockchain
- Some require centralized login services - defeating decentralization
- Some use clearnet services like DNS, NTP (blockable, traceable)
## The SAFE Solution
- **"If the network is secure then that's where you store the data"**
- The data storage location IS the location that secures the data
- **"Securing data means securing the actual data"**
- Key principle: **"Make it autonomous AND THEN make it decentralised"**
