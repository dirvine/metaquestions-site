This blog post explores the shift from data-centric to knowledge-centric models in the digital landscape, covering five key areas:
1. **Digital Advertising Reimagined** - Moving from attention capture to value-based advertising assisted by AI
2. **Personal Data to Personal Knowledge** - Using machine learning and vector databases to extract knowledge while minimizing storage and enhancing privacy
3. **Collective Wisdom & Shared Data** - Knowledge sharing using cryptographic techniques (Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-Knowledge Proofs) and anonymized response mechanisms
4. **Secure Knowledge Management** - Leveraging the SAFE Network's decentralized, privacy-focused approach for secure knowledge sharing
5. **Nano Payments** - Enabling autonomous transactions through SAFE Network's nano payment capabilities combined with personal AI
## Conclusion
The author envisions a future where individuals have greater control over their data and knowledge, new business models emerge, and privacy becomes a fundamental pillar rather than an afterthought.
